        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a newly qualified Machine Learning Engineer with over 13 years of experience in sales roles, now transitioning back into the tech industry. I have recently completed a comprehensive refresher course in Python, Machine Vision, and common Machine Learning techniques. Holding a Master's degree in Computer Science from 2005, I have previously worked with C++ and Fortran90 during the initial stages of my Ph.D. I am eager to leverage my diverse skill set and experience in tackling new challenges in the field of Machine Learning.

            <h3>Project 1: Facebook Marketplace Product Recommendation</h3>
            <p>
                Developed a product recommendation system inspired by Facebook Marketplace's approach to providing users with relevant suggestions. The model was trained on a dataset of 12,000 product images, leveraging the power of FAISS to efficiently identify and display images similar to those favored by users. To ensure seamless integration and scalability, the system utilizes a RESTful API hosted within a Docker container on Amazon EC2.

            <h3>Project 2: Rock-Paper-Scissors Hand Gesture Classification</h3>
            <p>
                Developed a machine learning model to classify hand gestures in a live web feed for playing a game of rock-paper-scissors. The model was trained on over 10,000 images and achieved an accuracy of 90% on test data.

            <h3>Paper: Classical and Quantum Gibbs Free Energies and Phase Behavior of Water Using Simulation and Cell Theory</h3>
            <p>
                Collaborated closely with the lead author to implement and test their computational chemistry theory as a sub-component of two leading Computational Chemistry software packages. Developed libraries for both AMBER and DL_POLY using Fortran90 and C++ that integrated seamlessly with the large, parallelized codebases of both packages. Depsite running on the "supercomputers" available to the university, the execution time of such similations was large enough that code efficiency and automated testing were critical to the successful testing of the lead author's theory.
