        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a newly qualified Machine Learning Engineer with over 13 years of experience in sales roles, now transitioning back into the tech industry. I have recently completed a comprehensive refresher course in Python, Machine Vision, and common Machine Learning techniques. Holding a Master's degree in Computer Science from 2005, I have previously worked with C++ and Fortran90 during the initial stages of my Ph.D. I am eager to leverage my diverse skill set and experience in tackling new challenges in the field of Machine Learning.

            <h3>Project 1: Facebook Marketplace Product Recommendation</h3>
            <p>
                Developed a product recommendation system inspired by Facebook Marketplace's approach to providing users with relevant suggestions. The PyTorch model was trained on a dataset of 12,000 product images, and leverages the power of FAISS to efficiently identify and display images similar to those favoured by users. To ensure seamless integration and scalability, the system utilizes a RESTful API via FastAPI and is hosted within a custom Docker container on Amazon EC2.

            <h3>Project 2: Anomaly Detection in Large Image Sets</h3>
            <p>
                Created a robust system capable of identifying anomalies within a collection of approximately 1 million unlabelled and highly similar images, intended for time-lapse video creation but with wide applicability to other large image datasets. This system employed Keras/Tensorflow to derive image embeddings, and utilized HDBSCAN Clustering to segregate images into different categories based on their similarity - including an outlier class for images that deviated from established norms. For efficiency, scalability, and adaptability at a large scale, the system incorporates Meta FAISS to approximate groupings for new images, thereby enhancing overall performance.

            <h3>Project 3: Natural Language Processing for Stock Market Prediction</h3>
            <p>
                Investigated a variety of NLP techniques with the aim of predicting stock market movements based on daily news headlines. The project processed 1.2 million headlines collected over 20 years and compared them to the daily fluctuations in the NYSE aggregated shares portfolio. Headlines were analysed to extract keywords that could potentially influence stock prices, and sentiment analysis was applied. Ultimately, no robust model emerged from the study, so retirement on a fortune remains a distant dream.

            <h3>Project 4: Rock-Paper-Scissors Hand Gesture Classification</h3>
            <p>
                Developed a machine learning model to classify hand gestures in a live web-cam feed for playing a game of rock-paper-scissors. The model was trained on over 10,000 images achieving an accuracy of 90% on test data, and classified the new frames using OpenCV and TensorFlow.

            <h3>Paper: Classical and Quantum Gibbs Free Energies and Phase Behavior of Water Using Simulation and Cell Theory</h3>
            <p>
                Collaborated closely with the lead author to implement and test their computational chemistry theory as a sub-component of two leading Computational Chemistry software packages. Developed libraries for both AMBER and DL_POLY using Fortran90 and C++ that integrated seamlessly with the large, parallelized codebases of both packages. Depsite running on the "supercomputers" available to the university, the execution time of such similations was large enough that code efficiency and automated testing were critical to the successful testing of the lead author's theory.
